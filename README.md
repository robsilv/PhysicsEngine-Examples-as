PhysicsEngine-Examples-as
=========================

Box2D and Nape physic engine examples in an easier to use format.

Getting the examples to work from the [napephys.com](http://napephys.com/downloads.html) website involves downloading the entire site from GitHub, creating an ActionScript project in FlashBuilder (or similar), finding the relevant classes in the samples section of the site, then copying and pasting into your new project.

Getting the examples to work from the [box2dflash.org](http://www.box2dflash.org/download) website involves downloading the zip, creating a library project for Box2D, copying the relevant files over, creating an ActionScript project for the examples, then copying over the relevant files and rejigging it a bit so it's not dependent on a Flash IDE publishing workflow.

This project has done all that for you, you just need to import Box2D, Box2DExamples and NapeExamples and you're ready to go.
